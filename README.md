# Image_To_Text_Caption_Generation
Developed an Image to Text Caption Generation system using the blip-image-captioning-large and mixtral APIs from Hugging Face.


Designed and implemented an Image to Text Caption Generation system leveraging the blip-image-captioning-large and mixtral APIs from Hugging Face. This system processes images to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions by utilizing state-of-the-art transformer models. The project involved integrating these pre-trained models, handling image preprocessing, and ensuring seamless interaction with the APIs for efficient caption generation. The resulting captions enhance image metadata, improve accessibility, and enable advanced image search and categorization functionalities.
